(Invoquote walkthrough).
And that's it! Now here is Amber and Chris to talk about some of the technical accomplishments.

## Technical Triumphs: Chris & Amber

AMBER: And I'm Amber. InvoQuote was my idea. I pitched it to our class and our Design Worth team brought it to life. My favorite part of this project was pair programming the core functionalities of the InvoQuote app like the basics of the project form with Alicia, local storage with Devin, and hiding and showing different parts of the Quote app with Chris.

AMBER:
I hope you enjoyed our little presentation. We had a lot of fun building our website and app but it wasn't all smooth sailing. We did run into some issues but we were able to overcome them with teamwork and persistence.

AMBER:
Some of the challenges we ran into were:
* Directing user experience and displaying our calculated data correctly in order to clearly present the proposal at the end of the app.
* Some of the things we did to help overcome these challenges included pair - or even group programming, and writing or drawing out our logic and structure to communicate our ideas and work them out with each other.
* Another product feature that our team enjoyed building is customizing the calculation of total cost based on user's design requests and timeframe needs.

CHRIS: Good afternoon, I'm Chris! [include quick personal info and goals related to CodeFellows]

* Another product feature that our team is especially proud of is the showing and hiding of the user forms and the display of the user's inputs and calculated cost in the final quote. I enjoyed helping to build this aspect of the project functionality of the user forms, as well as the display of the final quote.

* Worked in small stages to gradually build in our features. This ensured that we built on top of good code and if things went wrong, we would know what was causing it.

* Contribution Specifics:

Do you have any questions?
