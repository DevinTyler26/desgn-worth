# Project Presentation Scripting


## Introduction: Eric
Your time is important. And if you are a business owner and working with clients, their time is also important. Time is not something you can get back so maximizing it and not wasting it is key to better productivity and a better experience for both you and your clients.

What would you say if I were to tell you that we can help you eliminate the back and forth dance to move potential clients into being actual clients.

And here is InvoQuote ________________________.
(invoquote walkthrough).
And that's it! Now here is Amber and Chris to talk about the challenges we went through and overcame and to answer your questions.

## Challenges: Chris
CHRIS: Hi I'm Chris. I did....

AMBER: And I'm Amber. InvoQuote was my idea. I pitched it to our class and our Design Worth team brought it to life. My favorite part of this project was pair programming the core functionalities of the InvoQuote app like the basics of the project form with Alicia, local storage with Devin, and hiding and showing different parts of the Quote app with Chris.

AMBER:
I hope you enjoyed our little presentation. We had a lot of fun building our website and app but it wasn't all smooth sailing. We did run into some issues but we were able to overcome them with teamwork and persistence.

AMBER:
Some of the challenges we ran into were:
* Directing user experience and displaying our calculated data correctly in order to clearly present the proposal at the end of the app.
* Some of the things we did to help overcome these challenges included pair - or even group programming, and writing or drawing out our logic and structure to communicate our ideas and work them out with each other.

CHRIS:
* Another thing we did was to work in small stages or small steps to ensure we would gradually build in our features. This ensured that we built on top of good code and if things went wrong, we would know what was causing it.
* More specifically one of the challenges we ran into was after our app was mostly done and then we added the hiding/showing feature, it broke our app. We figured out that we needed to consolidate some event listeners in order to make it work again.
* Math for the multiplier and implementing local storage was also a challenge. For these, we had to go to the whiteboard to write out our code structure and logic.

Do you have any questions?
