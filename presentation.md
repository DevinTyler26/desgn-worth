# Project Presentation Scripting


## Introduction: Eric
Your time is important. And if you are a business owner and working with clients, their time is also important. Time is not something you can get back so maximizing it and not wasting it is key to better productivity and a better experience for both you and your clients.

What would you say if I were to tell you that we can help you eliminate the back and forth dance to move potential clients into being actual clients.

Hi, my name is Eric and I worked on the About Me Page for our site. We approached this project as a Web Development firm and built a cool app you can use for your agency or service based business.

At Design Worth we value honesty, getting inspiration from new tech and ideas, diversity, building communities, and lifelong learning. Out team is self-managed and everyone is accountable for what they do and for each other.

You can learn more about our team here on this page.

More importantly, we have our new product our InvoQuote that lets you send your potential clients a proposal or quote instantly. And here are Devin and Alicia to walk you through it.

## InvoQuote Overview: Devin & Alicia
Hi I'm ___________________.

And here is InvoQuote ________________________.
(invoquote walkthrough).

* Little bit about me, background, what I'm proud of and contributed too mixed into my part
* Introduce app, show in mobile version-designed mobile first responsive, tour nav pages- utilized a hamburger option for our menu.
* Introduce Quote homepage and user options
* Contact page
* Introduce Amber and Chris
###Devin
* Introduce local storage (restore/reset options)
* Forms and Project Proposal pages
And that's it! Now here is Amber and Chris to talk about the challenges we went through and overcame and to answer your questions.

## Challenges: Chris

AMBER: And I'm Amber. InvoQuote was my idea. I pitched it to our class and our Design Worth team brought it to life.

* My favorite part of this project was pair programming the core functionalities of the InvoQuote app like the basics of the project form with Alicia, local storage with Devin, and hiding and showing different parts of the Quote app with Chris.

* I also loved taking on the challenge and the triumph of solving bugs that we find along the way and sharing web design knowledge I have from before CodeFellows like using FlexBox and basic mobile first design.

* Getting a responsive menu and adding animation to the hamburger was also really fun.


CHRIS: Hi I'm Chris. I did....

* Directing user experience and displaying our calculated data correctly in order to clearly present the proposal at the end of the app.

* Worked in small stages or small steps to ensure we would gradually build in our features. This ensured that we built on top of good code and if things went wrong, we would know what was causing it.

* One of the challenges we ran into was a conflict with our quote page between the hide/show feature of the forms and the final display of the user's inputs in the quote. We discovered that we had competing event listeners and realized that we needed to consolidate them in order to make it work again. By pair-programming and coding our functions in small blocks at a time, we were able to quickly pinpoint the issue.

* Math for the multiplier and implementing local storage was also a challenge. For these, we had to go to the whiteboard to write out our code structure and logic.

Do you have any questions?
