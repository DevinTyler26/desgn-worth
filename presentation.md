# Project Presentation Scripting


## Introduction: Eric
Your time is important. And if you are a business owner and working with clients, their time is also important. Time is not something you can get back so maximizing it and not wasting it is key to better productivity and a better experience for both you and your clients.

What would you say if I were to tell you that we can help you eliminate the back and forth dance to move potential clients into being actual clients.

Hi, my name is Eric and I worked on the About Me Page for our site. We approached this project as a Web Development firm and built a cool app you can use for your agency or service based business.

At Design Worth we value honesty, getting inspiration from new tech and ideas, diversity, building communities, and lifelong learning. Out team is self-managed and everyone is accountable for what they do and for each other.

You can learn more about our team here on this page.

More importantly, we have our new product our InvoQuote that lets you send your potential clients a proposal or quote instantly. And here are Devin and Alicia to walk you through it.

## InvoQuote Overview: Devin & Alicia
Hi I'm ___________________.
And I'm ____________________.
And here is InvoQuote ________________________.

(invoquote walkthrough).

* Introduce app, show in mobile version-designed mobile first responsive, utilized a hamburger option for our menu.
* Introduce Quote homepage and user options
* Contact page
###Devin
* Introduce local storage (restore/reset options)
* Forms and Project Proposal pages
And that's it! Now here is Amber and Chris to talk about the challenges we went through and overcame and to answer your questions.

## Technical Accomplishments: Chris & Amber

AMBER: And I'm Amber Kim. I have been designing and building WordPress websites using prebuilt design tools, but my goal at CodeFellows is to be able to build extensive modern Web Apps from the ground up through CodeFellows.

InvoQuote was an idea I pitched to our class that was just a wishlist I wanted to have for my own website, and our Design Worth team brought it to life.

My favorite part of this project was collaborating with my teammates:
* pair programming the core functionalities of the InvoQuote app like the basics of the project form with Alicia
* local storage with Devin
* hiding and showing different parts of the Quote app with Chris, * solving solving bugs that we find along the alway
* and sharing web design knowledge I have from before CodeFellows like using FlexBox and basic mobile first design which I am very proud of my team who took to the challenge of learning these new tools so enthusiastically.
* Getting a responsive menu and adding animation to the hamburger was also really fun.
* I'm really excited to build even more amazing apps with my classmates for the rest of our time here at CodeFellows.


CHRIS: Good afternoon, I'm Chris! --include quick personal info and goals related to CodeFellows--

* One of the technical features of this project that I enjoyed working on and helping our team to solve was guiding the user experience and storing their data correctly in order to clearly display the proposal. Throughout the programming process we always kept the user in mind first, so we wanted to ensure that a) the forms were visually appealing, yet simple to use, and b) the user's design requests and timeframe needs were explicitly taken into account in calculating the final quote. We're confident that user will appreciate the simplicity in using the forms and the professional appearance

* Another product feature that our team is especially proud of is the showing and hiding of the user forms before displaying the final quote. I enjoyed helping to build this aspect of the project functionality because it adds value to the user experience by simplifying the information entry process.

* Some of the things we did to help overcome these challenges included pair - or even group programming, and writing or drawing out our logic and structure to communicate our ideas and work them out with each other.

* Worked in small stages to gradually build in our features. This ensured that we built on top of good code and if things went wrong, we would know what was causing it.
