    <p>Hey there! I'm Eric. I grew up in a small town called Medford, OR and now live in Seattle. I am married with no children, unless you count "fur babies." In that case, we have 3 dogs! I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, fishing, rafting, as well as indoor activities like watching movies or playing games.</p>
    <p> I first learned about Code Fellows from an ad on the radio and it caught my attention. After some research, I decided to attend a 101 Workshop to see if it was for me. I actually enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it, as well as learning a new skill.</p>
