#User Scenarios

##Developer
As a developer, I am interested in creating a website and app with a scalable scope that is easy to maintain and recycle functions/methods. I will use clear, clean, and consistent naming and syntax so other developers can understand the code and adapt it to their needs. I would like clear deliverables so I understand the client's expectations and what I need to produce as a product for the end-user.

##Client (freelancer/agency/business)
As a client, I am interested in a website and app service that is efficient and time saving. I would like the ability to screen customers and retain clear info from an end user.

##End User
As an end user, I am interested in a quick, pain-free process with an outstanding personalized experience that doesn't feel "sale-sy". I would like to enjoy the website and app quote process with a conversational feel to the questions I am asked and information I receive in return.
